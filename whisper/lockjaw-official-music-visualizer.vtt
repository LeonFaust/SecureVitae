00:00.000 --> 00:20.180
Why speaking out, like pulling teeth from my mouth

00:20.180 --> 00:25.260
The devil's got my tongue, they're bringing out the pitchfog

00:25.260 --> 00:29.800
Saying I locked your cars, locked your song, well

00:29.800 --> 00:33.640
Let's throw up out of trucks and vows, fuck too soon and I'm losing the crowd

00:33.640 --> 00:37.440
Drush your tight and tongue, I'm biting over and over again

00:37.440 --> 00:41.100
No true when I say what I say, low-key like a brick to the face

00:41.100 --> 00:45.060
Over-sharing, over-bearing, under-performing it fast

00:45.060 --> 00:50.940
Ooh, ooh, ooh, am I ever gonna open my mouth again?

00:50.940 --> 00:52.360
No, no, no

00:52.360 --> 00:59.900
Ooh, ooh, ooh, how am I ever gonna open my mouth again?

00:59.900 --> 01:04.900
Why just keepin' it down, feel like I'm pissed in a cage

01:04.900 --> 01:09.380
Formin' at the mouth, pickin' a lock on the malls

01:09.380 --> 01:14.040
All I got to keep me locked in a cycle and desperate to change

01:14.040 --> 01:18.300
Now I throw up out of trucks and vows, fuck too soon and I'm losing the crowd

01:18.300 --> 01:21.580
Drush your tight and tongue, I'm biting over and over again

01:21.580 --> 01:25.740
No true when I say what I say, low-key like a brick to the face

01:25.740 --> 01:29.580
Over-sharing, over-bearing, under-performing it fast

01:29.580 --> 01:35.580
Ooh, ooh, how am I ever gonna open my mouth again?

01:35.580 --> 01:37.620
No, no, no, no

01:37.620 --> 01:47.260
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

01:47.260 --> 01:51.020
No, no, no, no

01:51.020 --> 01:56.240
Oh, ooh, ooh, how am I ever going open my mouth again?

01:56.240 --> 01:59.340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

01:59.340 --> 02:01.480
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, are we gonna open my mouth again?

02:01.480 --> 02:31.460
We'll be right back.

02:31.480 --> 03:01.460
We'll be right back.

03:01.480 --> 03:05.480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
