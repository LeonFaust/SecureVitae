1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,180
Why speaking out, like pulling teeth from my mouth

2
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,260
The devil's got my tongue, they're bringing out the pitchfog

3
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,800
Saying I locked your cars, locked your song, well

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,640
Let's throw up out of trucks and vows, fuck too soon and I'm losing the crowd

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,440
Drush your tight and tongue, I'm biting over and over again

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,100
No true when I say what I say, low-key like a brick to the face

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,060
Over-sharing, over-bearing, under-performing it fast

8
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,940
Ooh, ooh, ooh, am I ever gonna open my mouth again?

9
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,360
No, no, no

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:59,900
Ooh, ooh, ooh, how am I ever gonna open my mouth again?

11
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,900
Why just keepin' it down, feel like I'm pissed in a cage

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,380
Formin' at the mouth, pickin' a lock on the malls

13
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,040
All I got to keep me locked in a cycle and desperate to change

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,300
Now I throw up out of trucks and vows, fuck too soon and I'm losing the crowd

15
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,580
Drush your tight and tongue, I'm biting over and over again

16
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,740
No true when I say what I say, low-key like a brick to the face

17
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,580
Over-sharing, over-bearing, under-performing it fast

18
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,580
Ooh, ooh, how am I ever gonna open my mouth again?

19
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,620
No, no, no, no

20
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:47,260
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

21
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,020
No, no, no, no

22
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,240
Oh, ooh, ooh, how am I ever going open my mouth again?

23
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

24
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,480
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, are we gonna open my mouth again?

25
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:31,460
We'll be right back.

26
00:02:31,480 --> 00:03:01,460
We'll be right back.

27
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
