0	20180	Why speaking out, like pulling teeth from my mouth
20180	25260	The devil's got my tongue, they're bringing out the pitchfog
25260	29800	Saying I locked your cars, locked your song, well
29800	33640	Let's throw up out of trucks and vows, fuck too soon and I'm losing the crowd
33640	37440	Drush your tight and tongue, I'm biting over and over again
37440	41100	No true when I say what I say, low-key like a brick to the face
41100	45060	Over-sharing, over-bearing, under-performing it fast
45060	50940	Ooh, ooh, ooh, am I ever gonna open my mouth again?
50940	52360	No, no, no
52360	59900	Ooh, ooh, ooh, how am I ever gonna open my mouth again?
59900	64900	Why just keepin' it down, feel like I'm pissed in a cage
64900	69380	Formin' at the mouth, pickin' a lock on the malls
69380	74040	All I got to keep me locked in a cycle and desperate to change
74040	78300	Now I throw up out of trucks and vows, fuck too soon and I'm losing the crowd
78300	81580	Drush your tight and tongue, I'm biting over and over again
81580	85740	No true when I say what I say, low-key like a brick to the face
85740	89580	Over-sharing, over-bearing, under-performing it fast
89580	95580	Ooh, ooh, how am I ever gonna open my mouth again?
95580	97620	No, no, no, no
97620	107260	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
107260	111020	No, no, no, no
111020	116240	Oh, ooh, ooh, how am I ever going open my mouth again?
116240	119340	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
119340	121480	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, are we gonna open my mouth again?
121480	151460	We'll be right back.
